# ArXiv_search_engine
A Flask Web App for Finding Research Papers via arXiv API
ArXive Search Engine is a Flask-based web application that allows users to quickly discover research papers from the arXiv repository. The app lets you search papers by topic, apply year filters, and view results in a clean, user-friendly interface. It uses the arXiv API (Atom feeds) and Feedparser to fetch real-time academic content and display the most relevant papers based on the user’s input.
With built-in pagination, multi-keyword support, and a well-structured UI, the app functions like a mini search engine tailored for students, researchers, and anyone curious about a specific domain.
